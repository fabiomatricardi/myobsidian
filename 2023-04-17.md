## How to determine what jobs are safe/unsafe? #futureofwork

**White collar:**

-   Repetition vs. strategic: #Newparadigma

1.  Does your job have minimal repetition of tasks?
2.  Do you regularly come up with insights that are important to your company?
3.  Do you make key decisions that cross functions for your company?

-   Simplicity vs. complexity: #Newparadigma 

1.  Do most decisions in your job require complexity or deliberation?
2.  In your job, do you need to regularly learn and understand a lot of complex information?

**Blue collar**

-   Dexterity vs. repetition: #Newparadigma 

1.  Does it require at least a year of training to be qualified for your job?
2.  Does your job involve very little repetition of the same task(s)?

-   Fixed vs. unstructured environment #Newparadigma 

1.  Is your job usually performed in different environments each time? (e.g., a taxi driver would always work in the same taxi)
2.  Is your work environment unstructured?

**For all jobs: human-contact / empathy / compassion**
WORKING WITH PEOPLE #Newparadigma 

-   Is communication and persuasion one of the most important parts of your job?

# The Real Reason So Many Jobs Are Pointless
## We care about jobs being created, but not meaningful ones.

_“In this town, it costs the government $60,000 per person to bring someone off the streets.”_

The problem with that organization is that they have tunnel vision on the problem and only think about what their current plan is. They never once considered what programs were already out there and making an impact.
But this overall trend is something that we see multiple times in every industry right now. Jobs are being created, but the substance of those jobs are either redundant or meaningless. And they are expected to be filled by someone.

### Innovation is somehow stopped

My point is that companies aren’t as innovative as they once were. And if they tried to hop on the latest fads to try and wow people, they failed spectacularly. Take AI as an example. With ChatGPT taking everything by storm, every major tech company is jumping on board with this “new technology.”

**But the current problem with AI and ChatGPT is that these technologies don’t innovate. They imitate.**

#### Now the workers themselves aren’t responsible for this stalling. Rather, it’s upper management that is responsible since they are overlooking the teams that create these products and make innovation happen. They’re the ones guiding and motivating the team to create these new products.


The innovations that we’ve seen in these cameras are not much to write home about. For sure, a modern phone has an amazing camera, but it’s not much better than a mid-tier point-and-shoot camera. And even with that, the point-and-shoot probably has a few extra features.

This has been the trend for years now. Every update to smartphones after a certain version was primarily devoted to the camera and less to the innovation itself.


# Most Businesses Have Become Parasites: A Final Iteration Of Untrue Capitalism

We’ve known about this problem for quite some time, as David Graeber reported his [findings in a 2018 book he penned](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Bullshit-Jobs/David-Graeber/9781501143335). His argument was that myths around the efficiency of capitalism have blinded us to the fact that a lot of economics is built on those striving for power and status. He argues that, from the start, capitalism was never made to bolster the economy.

He has a point.

Between mass layoffs, stock buybacks, and industries forming oligopolies, it’s obvious that across industries, this doesn’t boost the economy at all. And yet these are seen as wise business moves or strategies that every company should be doing.

I do believe there is _some_ form of good capitalism out there, but the vast majority of it is what we see today, which is utterly wasteful. There is a drive to prioritize power, influence, and profit without benefiting the public. William Baumol suggested this over 30 years ago, and his prediction is on the mark:

-   Companies _are_ buying up other companies whenever they get too large or rock the boat. This stomps any opposition or competition in the market.
-   Companies _are_ political as specific individuals appeal to those already in positions of power like [supreme court judges](https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow) and [senators](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/american-billionaires-spent-a-record-880-million-on-the-us-midterm-elections-.html). These ensure regulations are manageable and key companies stay on top.
-   Companies _are_ buying patents to ensure better products than what they offer never see the light of day.

Further evidence of all this is the multiple financial crises that we’ve run into. The fact that these things happen in modern markets shows the economy isn’t as efficient or as value-driven as it’s made out to be.

After all, we would be spending money and stimulating the economy if products were affordable, of great quality, and had multiple options.

A [30-year review conducted by Robert Litan and Ian Hathaway](https://hbr.org/2017/06/is-america-encouraging-the-wrong-kind-of-entrepreneurship) reveals that much of the “financial engineering” served to hide risk, dump risk on unsuspecting investors, or [raised risks overall](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2011-10-30/credit-default-swap-risk-bomb-is-wired-to-explode-mark-buchanan) despite being advertised as the exact opposite.

All of these things come back to Graeber, who tied these phenomena together in [his 2013 essay proclaiming a weird fact](https://www.atlasofplaces.com/essays/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs/):

**Upwards of 30 percent of jobs that companies create now do nothing useful to society.**

It might’ve seemed odd back then, but as time went on, the more it made sense:

-   A 2015 UK survey found [37 percent of people found their job not making an impact on the world](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/articles-reports/2015/08/12/british-jobs-meaningless).
-   A later poll in the Netherlands found 40 percent saying the exact same thing.
-   [Many hustle bros](https://medium.com/purposeful-life/behind-the-scenes-of-every-hustle-culture-bro-business-a8a20473cc98) love to talk about how [50% of the world hates their job or feels disengaged from it](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/12/job-unhappiness-is-at-a-staggering-all-time-high-according-to-gallup.html). They’ve been talking about that for over a decade.

When the company itself is focused on a goal that only benefits a few at the top, this sets the tone for those that work for it. At best, you feel disconnected. At worst, you’re stuck in a job that doesn’t go anywhere, an empty husk.

It’s easy to think that the signs of these jobs are obvious, but they’re not. Like the example I gave at the start, it has all the hallmarks of a job that would seem useful. But it’s redundant. Instead of hiring one person to oversee that program, there are three available positions: at a construction company that makes small homes, at a food bank, and as a financial advisor.

And that’s just the start.

Many large businesses have these "do nothing" positions in various departments, such as human resources and public relations. Furthermore, lobbying, telemarketing, consulting, and management companies do have their fair share too.

In the end, these jobs are akin to medieval feudalism. They are meant to stall and be a wedge for something else that would change the status quo. It’s a long way from what capitalism is supposed to be like.

Instead, it’s just siphoning off money and providing little merit to anyone beyond those at the top. Even if you’re getting paid in these positions.

### redefine capitalism
As my dad put it, we need to look beyond the boxes in which we contain our problems. We focus so much on a particular issue that we miss out on other important factors.

As much as we blame capitalism for the problems we’re in today, it’s more like we don’t understand how and why capitalism can help us. We’ve lingered on old business practices that date back to the 1970s and don’t reflect the economy today, so the outcome is predictable.

Productivity has stagnated as any drivers of change are stomped out by bigger and more resourceful companies that want to keep the status quo.

We need to [redefine capitalism](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/long-term-capitalism/redefining-capitalism) just like we need to redefine the work that we do. It’s not always about the quantity of the jobs that are being created, but the quality.

Maybe then we can get back to putting genuine effort into solving human problems.
