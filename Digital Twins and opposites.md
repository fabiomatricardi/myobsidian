Fantastic! this is real automation and engineering! It is interesting to see how the challenge to capture the real world object for you is the exact opposite of the industry trend about the use of digital twins. But in the end the computer vision pipeline here starts from the real world, not from drawings!

I also write about future of work and automation. if you have time please check my posts and give me a feedback.

>**CK |** I would say definitely the most challenging aspect was capturing this real world object, a shoe, digitally, modifying it and then translating it back into the real world. This is a kind of pipeline that is especially tricky for soft, deformable objects and objects that have wear and tear because it means we can’t work with any standard models. So making the system adapt to basically anything we put into it and making the translation back and forth reliable enough was definitely the biggest challenge.


Also great post from Andi Sama
## Box Sorting by Height use case implemented with Siemens TIA Portal and Factory I/O with Ladder Logic Diagram, based on Factory I/O's provided sample with minor modifications.

Great job Andi Sama.

The narrative about automation is too little focused on the real Industrial Automation. Here we move things and make every industry fulfill their job.

Factory I/O is also a perfect example of Digital Twin, that clients can see with their own eyes also during FAT.

How virtual reallity can be beneficial for training vocaational jobs #futureofwork 


# Key  Solution attempt to create on spot digitall twin
for training and for maintenance
revolution: whaat if you caan have it as a prototype in every phase of the project?

video transcriprion

whether you own build manage maintain or operate an oil plant inevitably issues arise that require immediate action and resolution.
With big data flowing in constantly from all sectors making sense of everything while troubleshooting
issues without wasting time can be a huge challenge. 
So what's the solution?
introducing hierarchy 4.0 and Innovative software solution for control Safety Systems 
Hierarchy 4.0 presents an interactive diagram of the entire plant revealing cause and effect Behavior with readings provided in a hierarchical view allowing for a deep understanding of the system's strategy 
All data is collected from multiple sources visualized as a diagram and optimized through a customized dashboard allowing users to run a logic simulation from live data or pick a moment from their history. 
Your simulation is based on actual safety Logics not just on a math model 
Now every users can prepare an RCA report 90 percent faster in just a few minutes.
Hierarchy can be used for any project phase starting from engineering to commissioning and up to operation and maintenance while supporting hazop Hazard analysis by reducing human error and avoiding incorrect documentation.
Hierarchy 4.0 supports plant operators in decision making taking into account both the safety and the operability of their assets. 
Hierarchy 4.0 Embraces a block log approach: it automatically calculates all Logics affected by an
override and gives a full understanding of constraints. 
Not convinced let's look at the data! 
During its first project hierarchy 4.0 prevented a revenue loss of 45 million dollars. 
Plants that utilize hierarchy 4.0 save up to 95 of their time and deliver a return on investment up to five times in value from day one and experience a Personnel utilization and plant efficiency increase by 20 percent per year.

Try our demo and make the move to hierarchy 4.0 today

A digital twin is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. Used in applications from modeling wind turbines to space capsules, digital twins are extremely useful for providing insights into a variety of sensor systems and their environment.

The human body is incredibly complex and thus challenging to simulate. With generative models, we may get one step closer to having our own health digital twin. Health digital twins are virtual representations of patients that are generated from multimodal patient data, population data, and real-time updates on patient and environmental variables [[Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00694-7#:~:text=Health%20digital%20twins%20are%20defined,on%20patient%20and%20environmental%20variables.)]. For example, generative models could be used to predict the outcomes of different treatment options and predict an individual’s response to different treatment options, personalizing medicine. The startup world is already investing in this idea: [Unlearn AI](https://www.unlearn.ai/) has raised [$50 million](https://www.fastcompany.com/90814042/digital-twins-drug-development-clinical-trials-ai-innovation) to build their platform that simulates potential health outcomes for individual patients using generative models.
