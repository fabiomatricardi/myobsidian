Wally: Well, why...why do you think that is? I mean, why is that, I mean, is it just because people are...are lazy today, or they're bored? I mean, are we just like bored, spoiled children who've just been lying in the bathtub all day just playing with their plastic duck, and now they're just thinking, "Well, what can I do?" 

Andre: Okay. Yes. We're bored. We're all bored now. But has it every occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing created by a world totalitarian government based on money? And that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks. And it's not just a question of individual survival, Wally, but that somebody who's bored is asleep? And somebody who's asleep will not say "no"? 
Andre: See, I keep meeting these people, I mean, uh, just a few days ago I met this man whom I greatly admire, he's a Swedish physicist, Gustav Björnstrand, and he told me that he no longer watches television, he doesn't read newspapers, and he doesn't read magazines. He's completely cut them out of his life because he really does feel that we're living in some kind of Orwellian nightmare now, and that everything that you hear now contributes to turning you into a robot. Andre: And when I was at Findhorn, I met this extraordinary English tree expert who had devoted his life to saving trees. Just got back from Washington, lobbying to save the redwoods, he's 84 years old, and he always travels with a backpack cause he never knows where he's gonna be tomorrow. And when I met him at Findhorn, he said to me, "Where are you from?" and I said, "New York." He said, "Ah, New York. Yes, that's a very interesting place. Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave, but never do?" And I said, "Oh, yes." And he said, "Why do you think they don't leave?" I gave him different banal theories. He said, "Oh, I don't think it's that way at all." 
Andre: He said, "I think that New York is the new model for the new concentration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves, and the inmates are the guards, and they have this pride in this thing they've built. They've built their own prison. And so they exist in a state of schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners, and as a result, they no longer have, having been lobotomized, the capacity to leave the prison they've made or to even see it as a prison." And then he went into his pocket, and he took out a seed for a tree and he said, "This is a pine tree." He put it in my hand and he said, "Escape before it's too late." 
Andre: See, actually, for two or three years now, Chiquita and I have had this very unpleasant feeling that we really should get out. That we really should feel like Jews in Germany in the late thirties. Get out of here. Of course, the problem is where to go, cause it seems quite obvious that the whole world is going in the same direction. See, I think it's quite possible that the 1960s represented the last burst of the human being before he was extinguished and that this is the beginning of the rest of the future now, and that, from now on there'll simply be all these robots walking around, feeling nothing, thinking nothing. And there'll be nobody left almost to remind them that there once was a species called a human being, with feelings and thoughts, and that history and memory are right now being erased, and soon nobody will really remember that life existed on the planet.


This weekend, the Facebook page _Anonymous_ posted [a short clip](https://www.facebook.com/anonews.co/videos/vb.997108126967413/1194970747181149/?type=2&theater) from the 1981 movie _My Dinner with Andre_ that went viral. In the clip, one of the characters provides an absolutely chilling perspective on the world in 1981—one that in many ways applies to today, and has even perhaps been magnified.

Brave New World
**"Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley: A Dystopian Classic**   #dystopia 

"Brave New World" is a dystopian novel written by Aldous Huxley and published in 1932. The novel is set in a future society in which people are genetically engineered, conditioned, and socially manipulated to conform to the norms of the ruling class. The story follows the lives of several characters who struggle with their own desires and the constraints of their society.

The novel is often compared to George Orwell's "1984" for its portrayal of a totalitarian society. However, while "1984" depicts a society controlled by fear and oppression, "Brave New World" portrays a society controlled by pleasure and consumption.

One of the central themes of the novel is the conflict between individual freedom and the demands of society. The characters in the novel are trapped in a world where their desires are manipulated and controlled by the ruling class, and they must constantly struggle to assert their own individuality.

Another important theme is the danger of technology and its potential to dehumanize society. The novel portrays a world where science and technology have been used to create a society that is efficient and productive, but also sterile and soulless.

"Brave New World" is a thought-provoking and disturbing novel that raises important questions about the nature of humanity, the role of technology in society, and the importance of individual freedom. It is a classic work of dystopian literature that continues to be relevant today.
