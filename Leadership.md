Strategy is not a to do list, it drives a to do list

## **Strategy is not a to do list, it drives a to do list**

It took me awhile, but I began to realize that the _strategic_ part of my job was two-fold:

1.**We were still searching for a scalable and repeatable business model.** My job was to test our hypotheses about who were potential customers, what problems they had and what their needs were.

2.**Once we found these customers, marketing’s job was to put together the tactical programs** (ads, pr, trade shows, white papers, data sheets) to drive end user demand into our direct sales channel and to educate our channel about how to sell our product.

> Once I understood the strategy, the To Do list became clear. It allowed me to prioritize what I did, when I did it, and instantly understand what would be mutually exclusive.

## **Good luck and thanks for all the fish**

My students were going through the motions of [Customer Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976470705?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwsteveblank-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0976470705) rather than understanding the purpose behind it. It was trendy, they had read my book, and to them it was just another step on the list of things they had to do. **They had no deep understanding of why they were doing it.** So they were at a crossroads. Since their investors had asked them to launch now, what happened if their initial assumptions were wrong?

As they left, I hoped they would be really lucky.

# **Lessons Learned**

-   Entrepreneurs get lots of great advice.
-   Most of the advice entrepreneurs get is mutually exclusive.
-   Don’t execute on anyone’s advice if you can’t explain why you’re doing it (Or else it all becomes a To Do list).
