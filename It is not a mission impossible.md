Learning from scratch requires determination and dedication, but with the right approach and attitude it is achievable. It's often the case that starting from nothing is the best way to learn, as it allows for a full understanding of the subject matter and can help you develop important skills, such as creativity and innovative problem-solving. Learning on the job, meanwhile, can give you the opportunity to gain invaluable, hands-on experience in a particular field.

Learning on the job can be an invaluable experience. It offers a hands-on approach to gaining knowledge and skills that wouldn’t be available in a classroom setting. This type of learning highly encourages individual professional development and allows employees to quickly become comfortable with the tasks they’re responsible for performing.

One of the greatest advantages of learning on the job is the ability to learn from experienced professionals. Having daily access to colleagues who have been in the job for years can help to provide useful insight and advice about everything from day-to-day tasks to long-term career goals. A mentor or supervisor can also provide a sounding board for questions, thoughts and ideas about how to approach new goals or challenges.

### You learn working with multiple disciplines

Learning on the job also allows employees to gain experience working in interdisciplinary teams and to collaborate with colleagues on projects. Working in teams can offer new perspectives, help develop communication skills, and allow for the sharing of resources and expertise. Additionally, it can help strengthen problem-solving and critical thinking skills in a fast-paced, real-world work environment.

### New questions to build your knowledge and insight

These experiences can help employees develop a better understanding of their job and career objectives. With knowledge and experience gained in their current role, employees can work toward branching into new and different industries, or even advancing their current position. Learning on the job can be a powerful tool to help employees reach their personal and professional aspirations.

It is possible to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in a career through both learning on the job and starting from scratch. Both have their own individual benefits, such as increased knowledge and improved problem solving for learning on the job and flexible learning opportunity and improved self confidence for starting from scratch. Therefore, these two strategies should be taken advantage of by those who are seeking to further their career. With effort and dedication, it is possible to gain the skills needed to succeed regardless of what approach is taken.
