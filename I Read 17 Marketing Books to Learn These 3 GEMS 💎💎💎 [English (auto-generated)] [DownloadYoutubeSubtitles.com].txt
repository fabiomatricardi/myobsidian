I read 17 marketing books this year

alone okay who am I kidding I listen to

most of them and while I learned a lot

these three secrets were by far the most

impactful and helpful for anyone who's

trying to Market their small business

and increase their profits and the cool

thing is these aren't just three random

unrelated lessons if you stick around

for all of them you can actually stack

them one on top of the next for what I

would consider to be the overall perfect

marketing super strategy so you'll

increase awareness traffic desire and

most importantly sales and you don't

need to read 17 different books because

I'm going to cover all the good parts

and connect the dots for you in this

video okay so let's start strong with

the first secret there are five easy

pieces to Market any business

now this one comes from the book

marketing Made Simple by Donald Miller

and J.J Peterson because sales don't

happen as a result of any one thing not

an ad not an email not even your website

it's a smart strategic combination of

different marketing pieces put together

in the right sequence that does it as

the book States most believe marketing

is an art not a science we disagree

while there is Art involved it is very

much a science a science you can learn

and the book goes on to prove that point

by laying out the exact five pieces of

marketing collateral that you need to

create along with the why and more

importantly the how to do it part so the

reason this works so well is because

these five pieces can all be mapped onto

the three stages of sales psychology

curiosity Enlightenment and finally

commitment and here's the exact list of

what the authors say you'll need to

create it all starts with the one-liner

or as they put it the one magical

sentence that will grow your business

it's basically your elevator pitch you

know a really short and succinct

statement that you can use to clearly

explain what you offer and the way they

explain how to create this one-liner

just follows a really simple formula you

bring up the problem your customers are

facing then your solution then the end

result it creates for them oh and you

have to do all of it in one or two

sentences and because I know how much

examples can help here's one that they

used in the book for a dentist office

most parents get stressed when they

think about taking their child to the

dentist that's the problem at kids teeth

our fun and welcoming office puts kids

at ease that's the solution so they

aren't afraid and their parents actually

enjoy the dentist visit the result this

is not only a really valuable exercise

and just being able to explain what you

do in a simple quick way that everyone

can understand and see the value in but

you can use this in pretty pretty much

all your marketing including your social

media profiles business cards your

emails and your website which just so

happens to be the next item you need to

create but not every website works and

as they say in the book your website

isn't a place to celebrate yourself your

website is a place where you sell your

customer a product that solves their

problem and makes their lives better and

this chapter goes into a lot of detail

about what goes into a website that

actually does that and that actually

just so happens to be something I can

show you in my free master class so I've

got a link to that down in the

description so click on that if you want

my exact blueprint for websites that

will actually sell your services next

you need a lead Magnet or as they call

it in this book a lead generator this is

essentially just a helpful usually

downloadable piece of content that you

give away for free in exchange for an

email address this can be as simple as a

PDF checklist or as complex as a video

training series but whatever format it

takes your lead generator should promise

to deliver a result and then make good

on that promise so no this should not be

a sign up for our newsletter or the six

things you need to know before creating

an Etsy Shop nobody wants a newsletter

or to know more things they want a

result they want a good outcome so lead

with that once they opt in with their

email address you'll set it to Auto

deliver to them using whatever email

program you like to use like whether

it's MailChimp or convertkit and

hopefully they act on it and you've

actually helped them get a quick win

because that's going to kick-start the

trust building process and make your

business more memorable plus you now

have their email which is what makes

marketing pieces four and five possible

those are nurture and sales email

campaigns this part is super important

because the follow-up emails that you

send out after someone's opted in for

your lead Magnet or where the money is

people come to your website once that's

great but the trouble is if they're in

the 96 percent of people who don't buy

because they aren't ready yet or they

just don't trust you as a business yet

who's to say they're ever going to come

back but when you send weekly emails

that show them a new tip or advice or

way to get the result they're after

you're accomplishing two goals for one

you're building a crazy amount of trust

and second you're staying in front of

them as a business over and over again

and that repetition is key to ultimately

getting the sale and speaking of sales

that's the final marketing piece from

this book sales emails so it's all well

and good to keep helping your prospects

but there comes a time to put up or shut

up right and by that I mean you

eventually need to ask for the sale or

at least give them the option for you to

really help them with your paid service

or product and when you have all five of

these pieces of marketing working

together you have a really dialed in

sales funnel that converts at a much

higher rate because you're speaking to

people at every stage of the buyer's

Journey you're making them curious with

your one-liner then your website lead

magnet and nurture emails are

enlightening them about what you can do

for them and finally your sales emails

will get them to commit and this does

all ultimately come down to having the

right website that can support the whole

funnel and again click the link down in

Master Class where I'll show you

everything you need for that okay time

for marketing secret number two the

value equation now this principle comes

from one of my favorite books I read all

year it's called 100 million dollar

offers by Alex hermosi and what I love

most about this book is that it's not

about changing what you offer at all

it's just about changing how you talk

about it that can help you sell way more

of your offers for significantly more

money money and to do that you need to

make people see the true value of what

you can offer them but most businesses

and marketers tend to focus on the what

this will do for you part but that's

just one piece of the puzzle this

equation actually outlines four

components that go into how valuable an

offer is perceived to be so in section

three of the book Alex says that if you

provide enough value your offer should

always be a steal for the prospect so on

the top line we have the dream outcome

and the perceived likelihood of

achievement in other words how good is

the outcome you're promising and How

likely is it that your business will

actually get them that outcome then on

the bottom line is the time delay or how

long they have to wait to get it and

effort and sacrifice in other words how

much work are they gonna have to

personally put into it the way this

works is you want to use the words on

your website in any of your other

marketing materials to make the top two

components seem as high as possible the

dream outcome should be big and the

likelihood of achievement should be

really high and this is where most

amateurs Focus all their effort by

inflating these top parts to ridiculous

levels that can kind of come across as

skeezy used car salesman tactics what

they don't realize but Alex does is that

most really successful companies

actually Focus just as much if not more

on decreasing the bottom line elements

how can you communicate that it won't

take much time to get good results or

that your customers don't have to put in

a lot of work to get what they want and

of course every business is different

and you may need to focus more on the

top line stuff if you can't claim that

it's quick or easy or you might need to

focus more on the bottom line if you

can't promise you'll fundamentally

change someone's life for the better but

in really simple terms the higher you

can get the top line and the closer to

zero you can get the bottom line the

better and again use the words on your

website to convey all of this it can

literally be as simple as four sections

just stacked on top of each other

talking about each element there are a

ton of ways you could do it just make

sure you address all four and you're

golden okay now for the third valuable

marketing secret video is non-negotiable

this comes from the absolutely

game-changing book they ask you answer

by Marcus Sheridan here's the truth the

way we make buying decisions has changed

dramatically over the last decade fact

70 percent of those decisions happen

before your customers have ever even had

a sales conversation with you or anyone

in your business so what changed well

smart businesses started creating

helpful content that they put online

that helped their customers arrive at a

decision all by themselves and really

smart businesses know that video is by

far the best way to put that information

out there into the world the only

question is are your potential customers

going to find helpful video content from

your competition or from you if you can

produce helpful videos that educate your

potential customers on how to get

results for themselves or that helps

them figure out their options answers

their questions proactively it helps

them make the best decisions for them

you're just going to build up massive

amounts of Goodwill and Trust which is a

great thing because like it or not with

so much information readily available

online only the most trusted businesses

can even hope to survive and while the

author Marcus Sheridan does concentrate

most on what he calls the selling seven

or the seven different uh types of

videos you can create that will help you

make a more bottom of funnel sales video

can do quite a bit for your top of

funnel marketing too so if you make the

right educational or how-to videos and

title them right that's how a lot of

your future customers can actually find

you in the first place you can put these

videos right here on YouTube then embed

them on your website to get found in

both Google and YouTube searches and

since the videos he goes into are mostly

about sales I will go over a few of

those types because they can actually be

pretty useful for your marketing too and

the first one he talks about is called

the 80 video so this is pretty much just

a series of videos that each answers a

question that roughly eighty percent of

your customers regularly ask you this

can be super short and sweet and you can

put them on your service pages on your

FAQs page or in your social media he

then recommends taking your top seven

questions and putting them into one

longer super cut which becomes your

finished 80 video so why seven right

Sheridan says that we've simply found

with our own clients that seven tends to

be the most effective number so another

video he recommends making is the

product and service fit video so these

are going to go on your home page if you

just sell one product or service or on

your various product and service Pages

if you have more than one and each video

in this category will just say who your

service is for and more importantly who

it's not for and I love this quote

because it sounds counterintuitive to

come right out and say who you're not

for right well Marcus has a different

opinion on that he says the minute we're

willing to say what we're not is the

precise moment we become dramatically

more attractive to the those for whom we

are a good fit next he recommends

creating cost and pricing videos so

earlier in this book Marcus has a whole

section about why you need to address

pricing on your website and the reasons

are pretty compelling ultimately it's

all about being really transparent to

build trust and this video can

accomplish that plus it can be a great

way for people to find you when they

search for pricing information online

which pretty much everybody does and

even if you can't just say you know we

charge this exact price for this exact

service your pricing video or videos

should at least address the factors that

you base your pricing on also you want

to talk about your industry's pricing in

general so where do you fit into the

Spectrum and why are you higher priced

or lower and if you can properly work on

what we talked about in the last big

lesson the value equation this will

really help you sell your specific value

there anyway recommends creating one

cost video for every major product or

service you sell next we have customer

Journey videos which are essentially a

case study where you show from start to

finish what you did for a previous

customer starting from their initial

problem all the way through the solution

you provided and the end result

and of course this all hinges on having

the right kind of website where you can

display all this info all these videos

host your lead magnet and communicate

your value and I want to show you how

you can create that website yourself

including what to put on it and what to

leave off of it for maximum client
