The programmers know how to teach the difference between a cookie and a human, but do they know how to teach it that all cookies are good cookies? A little focus, a little forethought, and some direction might help the Ai system make better decisions. #Interdisciplinarity 

I write simple stupid analogies to highlight serious concerns. I write with purpose. This isn’t about Sesame Street. This is about Humanity. What I am suggesting is that we build an AGI whose sole intention is to save humanity, to love, honor, and cherish us. A marriage of Ai and humans. We need to write our marriage vows into the system on the wedding day.
The problem arises when the people developing the systems have a financial interest in getting their product to market. The first one to the starting line usually has the advantage. Taking shortcuts and forgetting to build human interest into the system **_“could”_** create a problem.

If we build a system to act human-like, we should expect it to act human. That means emotional outbursts, biases, and phobias. My suggestion is that we create a Worldwide Ai Crisis Management team with a thousand programmers from every country. They should have a background in Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology. #Interdisciplinarity #inspiration #freeGPT #dystopia #Newparadigma

Thanks Fabio. I'll check out your writings as well. The tech giants used to have social scientists on product teams, but they dumped them. Profit over people.

aa monster in the room
Sorry for the delay in response, I am taking a much-needed vacation. My Day job keeps me busy. Yes, you can reference and use my blog. The more people that read it and understand it the better. We are on the cusp of monumental change in society, and everyone seems to be ignoring the monster in the room. Let's try to make friends with the monster is my attitude. Thanks for reading my blog. Steve

#futureofwork #Newparadigma story repeat itself
Like Photoshop, a few years later, PageMaker and the newly-affordable laser-printing tools of the 80s also sounded a death knell for entire disciplines. Cutting rubyliths, photographing halftones, stripping (not that kind) and many other precision crafts went away, but many others developed. Whatever you think of it, grunge typography and design would not have happened without digital tools. On the audio side: rap required beat boxes and drum machines. Will AI similarly create new disciplines and new areas of expertise? It’s hard to imagine what those might be, but painters in the 19th century felt the same way — at first.

When listening to photographers expressing moral outrage at the injustice of AI technology, it’s hard not to hear the echoes of 19th-century painters who were certain that photography would bring about the end of art. They, of course, made their living largely off of painting portraits and so recognized that the market for portrait painting had mostly come to an end. Without question, many of them did lose work and so bailed out to other professions. The ones who recognized that cameras couldn’t do everything went on to create impressionism, cubism and abstract expressionism.

Without question, many CEOs will choose to put shareholder value over the well-being of their employees and so will choose to turn paying work over to an AI. (They’re the ones who will take your job away — not a piece of software.) But as for the future of image making, AI will only lead us forward as those who have the wherewithal to do so will figure out how to discover and make media we’ve never seen before. These people will legitimize AIs as fine art tools, just as cameras were eventually recognized as such.
