> **_" It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are."_** - Roy Disney (1893 - 1971)

We must never allow our core values to be compromised – by anyone, especially ourselves. Yes, we can sometimes be our own worst enemy in this respect.

When we sell out to peer pressure to relinquish our values, we lose the essence of who we are.  Furthermore, we disrespect the memories of those we once admired and who instilled their admirable values within us. They include our parents and grandparents, close friends, teachers, clergy members and others in the community who could always be counted on to do the right thing.

It is easy to lose sight of our values these days, when people’s core values are easily compromised and openly sold off to the highest bidders. Too often we cave to appealing messages from false prophets attired in blue suits and red ties, competing for our attention, loyalty… and money.  They fire up the crowds, create false narratives with the intent to corrupt us for their own purposes. We must reject all such overtures that ask us to sell our souls to charlatans with devious intent. Our character values are our unique property and should never be put up for sale. They take time to grow and plant themselves in our being.

The formation of core values is a long journey that begins at birth and takes us through most of our lives. We may still be acquiring meritorious values right up until the end of our lives.  Sometimes that includes learning from past lessons and correcting flaws in our thinking and beliefs. Think of old Ebeneezer Scrooge, who in just one Christmas Eve, changed his entire outlook on people and went from being grossly cynical and uncharitable to becoming much more optimistic and giving of charity. All it took was some intense soul-searching, which helped show Scrooge the way to becoming a better and happier man.

**Be Consistent**

Stand firm and never give yourself away

Having a consistent value structure is important in any aspect of our lives. At home, as we raise our families to be honest and kind people. At work, where we build our integrity, gain buy in from customers, and mentor others. And, in our careers, where we build our professional network and reputation, which requires us to create relationships established with trust and cementing them with

Imagine if someone who had always known and trusted you to be an ethical person got burned by learning that you changed – the hard way. In fact, imagine if that shoe were on the other foot and you were the one that got fooled?  Truly a shock to your system and a tremendous disappointment. Being taken by surprise rarely ends well.  Especially, when trusted others intentionally or even unintentionally deceive you because they have changed in some way.

We prefer consistency in our interactions with others. When we are struck by change, do we not begin to lose faith in all people? Sometimes, we are so jarred by a bad experience with someone we have come to respect over time that we begin to question the purpose of maintaining our own strong values. If they no longer matter to others, then why should they still matter to us? That begins am unfortunate  trip down into a rabbit hole from which there is no escape.

**Society Is at a Critical Juncture**

Give this subject matter additional serious thought. Our society is at a critical juncture.  Many of the high-minded values we once cherished are slipping away and we are allowing this to happen. Consider the pullback due to an erosion of respect for displaying and maintaining them.  Copycat behaviors that model negative values seep into our homes, schools, workplaces and even our places of worship. They are aiming at shredding the civilized fiber that used to hold all of us accountable to one another. 

Case in point. When we fail to thank someone for a kind act our own children observe the                    non-gratuitous behavior and may not gesture appreciation for some courtesy expressed to them. Over time, things turn towards indifference and a bad “message” goes viral.  What was once considered to be a polite show of appreciation is repeated less frequently until it completely fades from our normal expectations. When saying “thank you” becomes extinct, so does answering: “you’re very welcome.”

**Trust the _“Old Ways”_**

In this particular case, it is recommended that you put your trust in the “old ways.” Remember what you were taught about practicing good values. They were conceived with kindness and respect for others in mind. We are people and not objects devoid of feelings and worth. Show some respect. Have manners. Be considerate of others and never try to deceive them. Even more importantly, hold on tight to your values and never let go.

As more people begin to change their spots and stray from their values, you will remain a symbol for others to reflect on. We must all accept that living a good and wholesome life requires each of us to possess and call upon good values and to hold ourselves and others accountable to a higher standard. This is a necessary thing if we do not want our society to regress rather than prepare for an optimistic future filled with wonderful things that past generations never knew. Why ruin it by creating more people for modern times, who are going in reverse and becoming more uncivilized?
