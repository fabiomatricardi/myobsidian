I started my studies in philosophy, and I ended up working as a software engieer.

Engineers should read about philosophy to gain a better understanding of their work that goes beyond the technical aspects of engineering. Philosophical concepts such as ethics, values, and systems thinking are essential components of engineering problem-solving and decision-making. Reading about philosophy can help engineers develop broader perspective and improve their critical thinking. Additionally, studying philosophy allows engineers to recognize the moral implications of their work and cultivate a greater appreciation for the impact of engineering decisions on society.

By taking a step back and looking at technology from a philosophical perspective, engineers can imagine the consequences of their decisions and the possibilities for the future. Moreover, an understanding of philosophical thought can help engineers craft a vision of a better future. To that end, engineers should strive to seek knowledge outside of the technical realm, and broaden their understanding of philosophy by reading and engaging in conversations with experts.

Exploring philosophy can help bring greater purpose and meaning to engineers’ work. Philosophical concepts such as empathy and morality can help engineers create innovative solutions to complex engineering problems and develop a sense of responsibility for their actions. By gaining a deeper understanding of philosophical topics, engineers can become more aware, mindful, and socially responsible professionals.

Humanistic thinking in software engineering refers to the idea of designing software systems with the users' needs and experiences in mind. It is a perspective which emphasizes the importance of user-friendly, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing software that is designed to maximize the user’s satisfaction, while at the same time minimizing their frustrations. This type of thinking is becoming more and more popular as software engineers seek to create an optimal experience for their customers. This means taking into account the user’s needs, behavior, interests, preferences, and experience when designing the software system. It also entails understanding the user’s context, such as socio-economic status, age, level of comfort with computers, etc. in order to create and tailor

Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) which meet their needs. By understanding the user’s needs and experiences, software engineers can create a software system that is both effective and user-friendly, resulting in a more positive user experience overall.

## **If I did it, you can do it too**

I started my studies in philosophy, and I ended up working as a software engineer in Industrial Automation. The biggest challenge on the first assignment was to prove anyone (and myself) that I was able to do it.

Follow me to to uncover how chances can take you to the career of your aspirations and how you can benefit the most starting from scratch.

Seizing the Opportunity…

When my first daughter was about to born, many things changed and my job as a teacher was not enough anymore. I started to look around for a solid occupation with not so much luck.: searching for a reliable job proved fruitless and I found myself in the urge to take whatever occupation as long I could support my family.

In 3 years I started 4 jobs, usually 2 at the same time, and even though I was able to take care of my wife and kid my discomfort was increasing everyday. I was waiting for my chance for a change: during my work at night I met a colleague that was working in an offshore rigs as PLC engineer.

If they did I can do it too!

Yes, you can! If someone else has done something, it doesn't mean that you can't do it too. It just means that you need to practice and put in the effort to learn how to do it.
