What happens before you start building an Incredible one

"Inside Incredible Machines" is a documentary series that explores the engineering feats and technical capabilities of some of the world's most impressive machines. The series features former NASA rocket engineer Chad Zdenek as he goes up close and personal with mega machines such as cargo planes, excavators, drag racers, and more. Each episode delves deep into the heart of the machine to uncover the engineering behind its design, its history, and its remarkable stories. If you have never watched it, give it a shot: it is truly amazing!

what is system engineering

Systems engineering is a field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on designing, integrating, and managing complex systems over their life cycles. It utilizes systems thinking principles and interdisciplinary approaches to organize and manage the engineering, business, and management aspects of a project or a system. Systems engineers oversee all aspects of a complex system to solve problems, from the initial creation of the system to production and beyond. They work in a variety of fields, including aerospace, defense, transportation, and manufacturing, among others. Overall, systems engineering enables building, analyzing, and managing systems in various fields, including electrical, mechanical, chemical, biological, or those involving business processes.

While systems engineering has been an important discipline for many engineering projects, the NASA Space Shuttle program is often cited as a specific instance where systems engineering principles were extensively applied. The Space Shuttle program was an ambitious project that required integrating numerous complex and diverse components from different teams and organizations. Consequently, the Space Shuttle program was a pioneering effort in the application of systems engineering principles to the design and operation of large, complex systems. In particular, NASA's approach emphasized a disciplined, structured process for defining, analyzing, and verifying requirements for the Shuttle's many components, systems, and subsystems. The experience of the Shuttle program has since helped to inform and shape modern systems engineering practices in a wide range of industries and fields.
