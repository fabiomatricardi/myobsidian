MULTIVAC
Multi-Vac is a fictional, sentient computer that serves as the central artificial intelligence in charge of the Earth Empire and is responsible for its decision making. It was created by Isaac Asimov and first appears in his 1957 short story "The Naked Sun". The name Multi-Vac is derived from multiple sources, including:

-   Multivac: A series of early electronic digital computers introduced in the mid-20th century designed to solve systems of simultaneous equations
-   UNIVAC I: An earlier electronic digital computer system, also known as Univac (Universal Automatic Computer)
-   M-5: Star Trek's Enterprise computer

Multi-Vac has appeared in several other science fiction works, including Pebble in the Sky and The Stars, Like Dust which feature it during development and The Robots of Dawn where its existence has been established but not seen on stage. In all of these instances, Multi-Vac serves as a symbol of humanity's technological hubris â€“ a vastly intelligent and powerful entity engineered by humans but ultimately beyond their control or comprehension. Its capabilities include being able to access information instantly across billions of stars, with knowledge stored directly in atomic form within molecular bond wave functions. It is capable of detecting even minute inconsistencies in reports submitted to it, such as those found in lie detection tests. It can calculate complex astronomical interactions between celestial bodies, perform statistical analysis of large populations, develop novel scientific theories, manipulate energy fields to create forcefields, operate spaceships remotely, etc.
